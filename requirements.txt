# NOTE on weasyprint dependency:
# weasyprint requires the GTK+ runtime environment for rendering.
# This is because it uses Cairo and Pango libraries which are often
# accessed via the GTK+ stack on various operating systems.
# For Windows, the required runtime can be obtained here:
# https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases

# Flow: run billing_cli.py -> uses invoice_service.py ( which is turn uses billing_service.py, pdf_service.py, and mailer_service.py in the same order )
